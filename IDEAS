Some of this may not be possible to do in 2.3...

- go TS6 only?
- client.c, channel.c is very 2.8 style still. it'd be nice to pack them into their own namespace and 
  such. moreover, the other 2.8 code needs similar rewriting/reworking too...
- internally split out +o/+v "ranks" into a series of permissions. this could allow for configure-defined 
  special access levels, halfops, etc. (would need to match globally, somehow. extra SVINFO param?)
- somehow hide channel operators like ircnet can do?
- SASL opering?
